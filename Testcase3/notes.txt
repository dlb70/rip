Test Case 3
Poisoned Reverse test case.

1. Routers 1 and 2 update each other at the same time.
2. Router 3 fails.
3. Routers 1 and 2 detect the failure at the same time.
4. Routers 1 and 2 set each other as the first hop to dest 4.
5. Poisoned reverse allows routers 1 and 2 to recognize this and break the 
    link immediately. Without it, the routes would have to time out to 
    be removed.
