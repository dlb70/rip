How to launch routers:

To launch one instance of a router;

    $ ./launch config/3.cfg

launches an instance of router 3. Each instance is run in a separate terminal.



To launch all 7 routers in a split-pane tmux session;

    $ ./tmux-launch

All instances run in a single terminal, using tmux as a multiplexer.
'ctrl-b + arrow keys' switches between terminal panels. 
An additional 8th pane is added, running as a bash prompt. 
All panes must be closed to exit tmux.
This is useful for testing remotely from an SSH prompt.



To launch all 7 routers in separate gnome-terminal windows;

    $ ./run

launches 7 individual windows each running a router instance.
